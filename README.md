Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Review


## General ##

1. Trained a LSTM based model for sentiment analysis
2. Vocab size was small 492 words as words entered by user were often mistyped
3. Used Amazon Reviews Dataset
4. Return scores for if the review is positive or negative 
5. Gives 90% accuracy on training data.
